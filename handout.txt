Getting Around
- Opening a single file
- Opening a folder or project
- Opening stuff from the command line
  - CLI ninjutsu:  ack -il --text 'platyp(i|us)' | xargs mate
- Opening files within a project
  - project drawer
    - ProjectPlus plugin (note quirky behavior in first-opened window)
  - Cmd+T
- Moving around on the current line
  - jump by word ( Opt+Left, Opt+Right )
  - beginning of line ( Cmd+Left and Ctrl+A )
  - end of line ( Cmd+Right and Ctrl+E )
- Moving around in a file
  - jump by paragraph/indentation ( Opt+Up, Opt+Down )
  - top/bottom ( Cmd+Up, Cmd+Down )
  - jump to line ( Cmd+L )
  - symbol selector (bottom right of window)
    - Cmd+Opt+T
- Setting and using bookmarks ( Cmd+F2, F2 )

Syntax Highlighting
- e.g., Textile support
  - note that you may have to add entries under Preferences / Fonts & Colors (markup.bold.textile, markup.italic.textile) to actually highlight Textile syntax
- Note that TextMate's approach allows grammars to embed each other, which is useful for, e.g., ERB
  - But creating a new grammar is freakin' hard, so I mostly leave them alone

Selecting text
- Mouse (duh)
- Shift+arrow keys (plus Opt or Cmd)
- Select current line ( Cmd+Shift+L )
- Column mode ( Opt+mouse; select text, then tap Opt )
- "Reverse" column mode (menu calls this "Edit Each Line in Selection") ( Cmd+Opt+A )

Text Folding
- manual (select text, F1)
- based on language grammar

Finding Text
- Find in file
  - note checkboxes in dialog
- Count occurrences in file (sigma button)
- Find in all files, native (MIGHT BE VERY SLOW)
- AckMate plugin (disgustingly fast, no replace)
- Cmd+F (note expanded form for long text, which I never use)
- Cmd+G (find aGain)
- Cmd+E (use selection for find) followed by Cmd+G

Replacing Text, Basic
- pretty much what it sounds like; use the Find window and
- incremental search ( Ctrl+S forward, Ctrl+Shift+S backward, doesn't appear all that useful )

FYI
- line/column info at bottom left
- show/hide line numbers, fold indicators, bookmarks
- show/hide drawer and status display ( Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+D )
- reveal current file  ( Ctrl+Cmd+R )

Whitespace
- Show/hide invisibles ( Cmd+Opt+I )
- Soft vs. hard tabs
- Convert tabs to spaces (or vice versa)
- Manual indent/deindent
- Auto-indent based on grammar
- Align '=' symbols ( Cmd+Opt+] )

Manipulating Text
- Switch case (variety of options)
- Align left/right/center/full justified (not terribly useful for plain text, but neat)
- Reformat line breaks ( Ctrl+Q )
- Quote ( Cmd+' )
- Move selection ( Ctrl+Cmd+arrows )
- Transpose (chars, lines) ( Ctrl+T )
- Delete to end of line ( Ctrl+K )
- Delete line ( Ctrl+Shift+K )
- Wrap selection in paired characters, e.g., (), [], {}, ""
- Sort lines in selection

Entering Text
- Type, copy/paste (booooring)
- Duplicate current line ( Ctrl+Shift+D )
- Snippets (simple) (ex: 'lorem')
  - note that snippets don't have to make things longer!  ex: should <--> should_eventually
- Snippets (with tab stops, default values) (ex: 'h1' in the Textile bundle)

Manipulating Code
- Change surrounding markers
  - Change quoting style ( Ctrl+" in the Source bundle )
  - Change string to symbol
  - Change ERB tag style ( Ctrl+> )
  - Change {} to do..end ( Ctrl+{ in the Ruby bundle )
- Working with HTML
  - Start a new tag ( Ctrl+< )
  - Wrap selection in a tag ( Ctrl+Shift+W )


----- STUPID EDITOR TRICKS -----

Finding/Replacing Text, Advanced
- Regex find!
- Regex captures in replace!
(DEMO: take predictably formatted text and turn it into a TSV)

Math?  In a text editor?
- Ctrl+Shift+C brings up _C_alculation commands
  - Basic math evaluation
  - hex/octal/decimal conversions
  - Awesome feature:  send line to google calculator

Commands
- Run selected text (or line, or entire file) through an arbitrary script of your choice
  - Insert a column of sequential numbers!  ( Cmd+Opt+# in my bundle )
    - In column mode!
  - Note that this is how the command to align '=' characters is implemented.
    - there's a Haskell implementation that was used as a demonstration for 'tying the knot'
