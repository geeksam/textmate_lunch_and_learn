Getting Around
- Opening a single file
- Opening a folder or project
- Opening stuff from the command line
  - CLI ninjutsu:  ack -il --text 'platyp(i|us)' | xargs mate
- Opening files within a project
  - project drawer
    - ProjectPlus plugin (note quirky behavior in first-opened window)
  - Cmd+T
    - examples: 'g', 'a', 'al'
- Moving around on the current line
  - jump by word ( Opt+Left, Opt+Right )
  - beginning of line ( Cmd+Left and Ctrl+A )
  - end of line ( Cmd+Right and Ctrl+E )
- Moving around in a file
  - jump by paragraph/indentation ( Opt+Up, Opt+Down )
  - top/bottom ( Cmd+Up, Cmd+Down )
  - jump to line ( Cmd+L )
  - symbol selector (bottom right of window)
    - Cmd+Opt+T
- Center current line on screen ( Ctrl+L )
- Bookmarks ( Cmd+F2 to set; F2 and Shift+F2 to go forward and back )

Syntax Highlighting
- e.g., Textile support
  > see README.textile
  - note that you may have to add entries under Preferences / Fonts & Colors (markup.bold.textile, markup.italic.textile) to actually highlight Textile syntax
- TextMate's approach allows grammars to embed each other, which is useful for, e.g., ERB
  - But working with grammars is mind-bendingly hard, so I mostly leave them alone

Selecting text
- Mouse (duh)
- Shift+arrow keys (plus Opt or Cmd)
- Select current word ( Ctrl+W )
- Select current line ( Cmd+Shift+L )
- Column selection mode ( Opt+mouse; select text, then tap Opt )

Text Folding
- manual (select text, F1)
- based on language grammar
  > see my_cool_script.rb

Finding Text in the Current File
- Find ( Cmd+F )
  > see camelids.txt
  - note checkboxes in dialog
  - note expanded form for long text, which I never use
  - count occurrences in file ( sigma button )
  - Oh, and you can replace from here too.  (More on this later.)
- find aGain ( Cmd+G )
- Use selection for find ( Cmd+E, then Cmd+G )

Finding Text in the Current Project
- Find in all files, native ( Cmd+Shift+F)
  - MIGHT BE OMFG SLOW
- AckMate plugin
  - Disgustingly fast (and doesn't block the whole app!), but has no replace feature
  - only search in specified filetypes
  - scope to current folder (hold down Command when searching)

FYI (aka Fugawi?)
- line/column info at bottom left
- show/hide line numbers, fold indicators, bookmarks
- show/hide drawer and status display ( Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+D )
- reveal current file  ( Ctrl+Cmd+R )

Whitespace
> see whitespace.rb
- Show/hide invisibles ( Cmd+Opt+I )
- Soft vs. hard tabs
- Convert tabs to spaces (or vice versa)
- Manual indent/deindent
- Auto-indent based on grammar
- Align '=' symbols ( Cmd+Opt+] )

Manipulating Text
- Switch case (variety of options)
  # I AM EXAMPLE TEXT
  - Upper ( Ctrl+U )
  - Lower ( Ctrl+Shift+U )
  - Title Case ( Ctrl+Option+U )
  - Opposite Case ( Ctrl+G )
- Align left/right/center/full justified (not terribly useful for plain text, but neat)
- Reformat line breaks ( Ctrl+Q )
- Quote ( Cmd+' )
- Move selection ( Ctrl+Cmd+arrows )
- Transpose (chars, lines) ( Ctrl+T )
- Delete to end of line ( Ctrl+K )
- Delete line ( Ctrl+Shift+K )
- Wrap selection in paired characters, e.g., (), [], {}, ""
- Sort lines in selection ( F5 )
  - Note that this introduces bundle item overloading: you can assign more than one item to a keystroke, and if it's ambiguous, TextMate will ask you what you mean when you use it.

Entering Text
- Type, copy/paste (booooring)
- Duplicate current line ( Ctrl+Shift+D )
- Snippets (simple) (ex: 'lorem')
  - note that snippets don't have to make things longer!  ex: should <--> should_eventually
- Snippets (with tab stops, default values) (ex: 'h1' in the Textile bundle)

Multi-line Editing
- Column editing ( Opt+mouse; select text, then tap Opt.  Then type. )
- "Reverse" column mode (menu calls this "Edit Each Line in Selection") ( select lines, Cmd+Opt+A, type )

Manipulating Code
- Change surrounding markers
  - Change quoting style ( Ctrl+" in the Source bundle )
  - Change string to symbol
  - Change ERB tag style ( Ctrl+> )
  - Change {} to do..end ( Ctrl+{ in the Ruby bundle )
- Working with HTML
  - Start a new tag ( Ctrl+< )
  - Wrap selection in a tag ( Ctrl+Shift+W )


----- STUPID EDITOR TRICKS -----

Using TextMate as a Command-Line editor
- No TextMate mode for the shell, I'm afraid.  But you can use it anywhere you might otherwise inadvertently launch vi, emacs, nano, etc.
- "mate -w" will launch a window and only return once that window is closed.
  > see ~/command_line_fu/environment_variables

Replacing Text, Advanced
- Regex find!
- Regex captures in replace!
(DEMO: take predictably formatted text and turn it into a TSV)

Math?  In a text editor?
- Ctrl+Shift+C brings up _C_alculation commands
  - Basic math evaluation
  - hex/octal/decimal conversions
  - Awesome feature:  send line to google calculator

Git Integration
- Git blame (I use this so often I moved it to the top in the bundle menu)
- Show uncommitted changes
- Compare revisions
- ...and more!  (I use the command line for making actual changes, though)

Commands
- Run selected text (or line, or entire file) through an arbitrary script of your choice
  - Insert a column of sequential numbers!  ( Cmd+Opt+# in my bundle )
    - In column mode!
  - Note that this is how the command to align '=' characters is implemented.
    - there's a Haskell implementation that was used as a demonstration for 'tying the knot'
